# TERMS OF SERVICE

**Last updated July 13, 2024**



## AGREEMENT TO OUR TERMS

We are Mario Kart DS Network staff ("we," "us," "our").

We operate this bot, as well as any other related products and services (collectively, the "Services") that refer or link to these terms (the "Terms").

This bot aims to provide tools for Mario Kart DS players. These range from links to useful and helpful pieces of information, software and the likes. It is capable of storing data within the form of profiles, which can contain Friend Codes, short user-set text and links to Mario Kart DS rankings.

You can contact us at [Mario Kart DS Network](https://discord.gg/pa9bea6).

These Terms constitute a binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and us, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Terms are posted.

The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms prior to you using the Services.

Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The bot aims to follow these Terms of Service and Policies:

## 2. USAGE

The Bot Owner grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Bot for personal or non-commercial purposes.



## 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

The Bot and all intellectual property rights therein are and shall remain the property of the Bot Owner. This, specifically, extends to any string stored in any of the databases of the Services, but not to any of the content that they may be referring to.
The User agrees not to copy, modify, or distribute the Bot or any portion thereof without the express written consent of the Bot Owner.

### Our intellectual property

We are the owner or the licensee of the intellectual property rights in our Services that includes all source code and databases and functionality. We do not claim ownership of any content that is outside of these categories.
The User agrees not to copy, modify, or distribute the Bot or any portion thereof without the express written consent of the Bot Owner.

### Your contributions and User Profile data

Please review this section and the "PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES" section carefully prior to using our Services to understand the (a) rights you give us and (b) obligations you have when you post or upload any content through the Services.

Any user who interacts, even passively, with the User Profile functions of the bot, will be given a "User Profile". A User Profile does not store, by default, any information about the User except for their User ID object, used to identify the unique account representing the User.

The information stored by the User Profile has to be submitted and selected by the User. Such submissions are considered Contributions, as they may invite you to chat, contribute to, or participate in blogs, message boards, online forums, and other functionalities during which you may create, submit, post, display, transmit, publish, distribute, or broadcast content and materials to us or through the Services, including but not limited to text, writings, video, audio, photographs, music, graphics, comments, reviews, rating suggestions, personal information, or other material ("Contributions").

You understand that the content, in one of its parts or in its entirety, of the Contributions that refer to third-party entities may be viewable by other users of the Services and possibly through third-party websites.

When you post Contributions, you grant us a license. Your Contributions, within the scope of the bot and/or Discord, can be used to:
- identify you from your Friend Code within the Services
- allow a fast sharing of your Mario Kart DS social media or Mario Kart DS rankings and permit other Users to access such data easily

Your Contributions, when and IF outside of Discord, will NOT be tied to any information that identifies you directly: your User ID will NOT be shared, as that is not any of our property; what we may, however, use is any of the content you incldued in your Contributions, without any link whatsoever to an identification of the original submitter.
THEREFORE ANY REFERENCE TO YOUR DISCORD USER ACCOUNT, ID OR ANY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY YOU OR YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT WILL NOT BE USED IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES.

You are responsible for what you post or upload: By posting Contributions through any part of the Services or making Contributions accessible through the Services by linking your account through the Services to any of your social networking accounts, you:
confirm that you have read and agree with our "PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES" and will not post, send, publish, upload, or transmit through the Services any Submission nor post any Contribution that is illegal, harassing, hateful, harmful, defamatory, obscene, bullying, abusive, discriminatory, threatening to any person or group, sexually explicit, false, inaccurate, deceitful, or misleading;
to the extent permissible by applicable law, waive any and all moral rights to any such Submission and/or Contribution;
warrant that any such Submission and/or Contributions are original to you or that you have the necessary rights and licenses to submit such Submissions and/or Contributions and that you have full authority to grant us the above-mentioned rights in relation to your Submissions and/or Contributions; and
warrant and represent that your Submissions and/or Contributions do not constitute confidential information.
You are solely responsible for your Submissions and/or Contributions and you expressly agree to being punished by us for any misusage because of your breach of (a) this section, (b) any third partyâ€™s intellectual property rights, or (c) applicable law.

We may remove or edit your Content: Although we have no obligation to monitor any Contributions, we shall have the right to remove or edit any Contributions at any time without notice if in our reasonable opinion we consider such Contributions harmful or in breach of these Terms. If we remove or edit any such Contributions, we may also suspend or disable your access to the Services.
