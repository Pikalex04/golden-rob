Add a new value (a port) to the table: enter `1024` for internal port and `65535` for external port, and for the type of port select `TCP&UPD`, if not present, just `UPD`. Make another port and follow the same procedure, just switch `1024` for external port and `65535` for internal port.\n\nThis should fix the problem, but you might want to whitelist your console to this rule (through Static IP Address or MAC) for security reasons."
