# Golden R.O.B.

A Discord Bot by Mario Kart DS enjoyers for Mario Kart DS enjoyers. Made with intensive usage of PRB!

## Description

Golden R.O.B. aims to provide easy and straight-forward access to the most useful Mario Kart DS resources.
Users will also be able to define a "User Profile". That is created by default when a User interacts within the server the bot is in, however it will be empty.
Users are capable of editing their profiles to:
* Display their country.
* Save thier Mario Kart DS Friend Codes, up to 5, and specifying their purpose (ex. ROM Hack, specific console...).
* Add their Mario Kart DS Rankings or their Social Media where they, supposedly, upload Mario Kart DS content (only major platforms are supported, such as YouTube or Twitch).

This information will be accessible to anyone in the server the User is in.
The purpose of User Profiles is to allow people to easily share their Friend Codes, their official Worldwide Rankings and their Mario Kart DS content.

The bot can also read a backup database of the Players' Page. This command is useful to check the Rankings from Discord or when the official database is not available.
Some custom functions, such as national AF, are also available.

The bot provides a help command for any of these functions. Check that out for more information about their usage.
